# Aggregation Solution

## Revising Aggregations - The Count Function
Query a count of the number of cities in CITY having a Population larger than 100,000.

Solution:

```MySQL
SELECT COUNT(POPULATION) FROM CITY WHERE POPULATION > 100000;
```

## Revising Aggregations - The Sum Function
Query the total population of all cities in CITY where District is California.

Solution:

```MySQL
SELECT SUM(POPULATION) FROM CITY WHERE DISTRICT = "CALIFORNIA";
```

## Revising Aggregations - Averages
Query the average population of all cities in CITY where District is California.

Solution:

```MySQL
SELECT AVG(POPULATION) FROM CITY WHERE DISTRICT = "CALIFORNIA";
```

## Average Population
Query the average population for all cities in CITY, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Solution:

```MySQL
SELECT FLOOR(AVG(POPULATION)) FROM CITY;
```

## Japan Population
Query the sum of the populations for all Japanese cities in CITY. The COUNTRYCODE for Japan is JPN.

Solution:

```MySQL
SELECT SUM(Population) FROM City WHERE CountryCode='JPN';
```

## Population Density Difference
Query the difference between the maximum and minimum populations in CITY.

Solution:

```MySQL
SELECT MAX(Population) - MIN(Population)
FROM City;
```

## The Blunder
Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: *actual - miscalculated* average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

Solution:

```MySQL
SELECT CEIL(AVG(Salary)-AVG(REPLACE(Salary,'0','')))
FROM  EMPLOYEES;
```

## Top Earners
We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly *salary X months* worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

Solution:

```MySQL
select max(months * salary), count(months * salary) 
from Employee where (months * salary) 
= (select max(months * salary) from Employee);
```

## Weather Observation Station 2
Query the following two values from the STATION table:
1. The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
2. The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of  decimal places.

Solution:

```MySQL
SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N), 2), ROUND(SUM(LONG_W), 2)
FROM STATION;
```

## Weather Observation Station 13
Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880 and less than 
137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.

Solution:

```MySQL
select truncate(sum(lat_n),4) from station where lat_n between 38.7880 and 137.2345;
```

## Weather Observation Station 14
Query the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION that is less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.

Solution:

```MySQL
select truncate(max(lat_n),4) from station where lat_n< 137.2345;
```

## Weather Observation Station 15
Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

Solution:

```MySQL
SELECT TRIM(TRAILING '0' FROM ROUND(LONG_W, 4))
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N = (SELECT MAX(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345);
```

## Weather Observation Station 16
Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than 38.7880. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

Solution:

```MySQL
SELECT ROUND(MIN(LAT_N),4) 
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780;
```

## Weather Observation Station 17
Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W)where the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION is greater than 38.7880. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

Solution:

```MySQL
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N = ( SELECT MIN(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780);
```

## Weather Observation Station 18
Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.
- *a* happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
- *b* happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
- *c* happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
- *d* happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

Solution:

```MySQL
SELECT ROUND((MAX(LAT_N) - MIN(LAT_N) + MAX(LONG_W) - MIN(LONG_W)), 4) AS D
FROM STATION;
```

## Weather Observation Station 19
Consider P1(a,c) and P2(b,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c,d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points P1 and P2 and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.

Solution:

```MySQL
SELECT ROUND(SQRT(POW(MAX(LAT_N)-MIN(LAT_N),2) + POW(MAX(LONG_W)-MIN(LONG_W),2)), 4) FROM station;
```

## Weather Observation Station 20
A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4 decimal places.

Solution:

```MySQL
Select round(St.LAT_N,4) mediam from station St where (select count(Lat_N) from station where Lat_N < St.LAT_N ) = (select count(Lat_N) from station where Lat_N > St.LAT_N);
```
